# TJS-Server
Table Joining Service (TJS) for vector tiles spatial framework

TJS-Server prototype was built to examine the potential of using vectortile caches as framework data for an TJS API based on OGC standards. This work is based on a <a href="https://cartographymaster.eu/wp-content/theses/2020_Chawanji_Thesis.pdf">MSC thesis by Sharon Chawanji</a>. The documentation on how to use the api is currently being developed on schawanji.herokuapp.com/.
